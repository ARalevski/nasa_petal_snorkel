0,The mechanics of the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods,"SUMMARY Research on the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is gaining renewed interest as it provides a source of guidance for the design of soft biomimetic robots that can perform functions currently not achievable by conventional rigid vehicles. The locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions (pedal waves) and relaxations (interwaves) that propagate from their tails to their heads. These ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground. The exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy. Specifically, the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear. To provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question, we use a newly developed technique to measure, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces. The traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave. We also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot, which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal. Simultaneously, the animal pulls the rim laterally inward. Analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought, showing significant spatial variation (acceleration/deceleration) as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal.",10.1242/jeb.046706,"['Attach', 'Move']",protect_from_radiation,actively_move_solids,actively_move_gases,0.6950101137498073,0.16066956614117323,0.1458308925373178,0,0,0
1,Catapulting Tentacles in a Sticky Carnivorous Plant,"Among trapping mechanisms in carnivorous plants, those termed ‘active’ have especially fascinated scientists since Charles Darwin’s early works because trap movements are involved. Fast snap-trapping and suction of prey are two of the most spectacular examples for how these plants actively catch animals, mainly arthropods, for a substantial nutrient supply. We show that Drosera glanduligera, a sundew from southern Australia, features a sophisticated catapult mechanism: Prey animals walking near the edge of the sundew trigger a touch-sensitive snap-tentacle, which swiftly catapults them onto adjacent sticky glue-tentacles; the insects are then slowly drawn within the concave trap leaf by sticky tentacles. This is the first detailed documentation and analysis of such catapult-flypaper traps in action and highlights a unique and surprisingly complex mechanical adaptation to carnivory.",10.1371/journal.pone.0045735,['Process resources'],attach_permanently,no_match,attach_temporarily,0.6263515181736474,0.13348399682526713,0.13348399682526713,0,0,0
2,Ultra-fast underwater suction traps,"Carnivorous aquatic Utricularia species catch small prey animals using millimetre-sized underwater suction traps, which have fascinated scientists since Darwin's early work on carnivorous plants. Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed—far above human visual perception—impeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5–20 h and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition.",10.1098/rspb.2010.2292,"['Process resources', 'Chemically modify or Change energy state']",regulate_reproduction_growth,no_match,attach_temporarily,0.7317525561111623,0.13348399682526713,0.13348399682526713,0,0,0
3,Elastic Energy Stores in Running Vertebrates,"Large mammals save much of the energy they would otherwise need for running by means of elastic structures in their legs. Kinetic and potential energy, lost at one stage of a stride, is stored temporarily as elastic strain energy and returned later in an elastic recoil. At high speeds, men and kangaroos seem to save in this way more than half the metabolic energy they would otherwise need for locomotion.It is shown by means of a generalized model that muscles and tendons could both be important as elastic energy stores. Analysis of films and force records of kangaroos hopping shows that strain energy stored while the feet are on the ground must be stored mainly distal to the knee. The principal muscles there have short fibres, and most of the storage must be in tendons. Investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet, distal to the ankle and wrist, are especially important. The scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered.Though the evidence presented in this paper comes mainly from a few species, the conclusions presumably apply to large mammals in general.",10.1093/icb/24.1.85,"['Move', 'Process resources']",protect_from_radiation,actively_move_solids,actively_move_gases,0.6950101137498073,0.16066956614117323,0.1458308925373178,0,0,0
4,The Great Silk Alternative: Multiple Co-Evolution of Web Loss and Sticky Hairs in Spiders,"Spiders are the most important terrestrial predators among arthropods. Their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat. Spiders are closely associated with silk, a material, often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences. However, it is often overlooked that more than half of all Recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation. These species must have found other, more economic solutions for prey capture and retention, compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity. Here we show that hairy adhesive pads (scopulae) are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style, resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least, equal importance as the derived web building taxa. Previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion, neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads (claw tufts) are suitable for those purposes. The former observations, that scopulae are used in prey capture, are largely overlooked. Our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are, in most cases, a secondary development. Evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones, as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further. Hypotheses about the origin of the adhesive setae and their diversification throughout evolution are provided.",10.1371/journal.pone.0062682,['Attach'],compete_within_between_species,regulate_drag_turbulence,actively_move_gases,0.7008855079203081,0.18210622809523574,0.1458308925373178,0,0,0
5,The hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications,"SUMMARY It has long been suspected that the denticles on shark skin reduce hydrodynamic drag during locomotion, and a number of man-made materials have been produced that purport to use shark-skin-like surface roughness to reduce drag during swimming. But no studies to date have tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin and skin-like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different orientations. We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a Speedo® ‘shark skin-like’ swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo® fabric, a 7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles. Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag-reducing effect of surface denticles. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading-edge suction, which might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed. Shark skin denticles might thus enhance thrust, as well as reduce drag.",10.1242/jeb.063040,['Move'],attach_permanently,protect_from_fire,protect_from_ice,0.5574475838432563,0.17717741964261077,0.17640131533646672,0,0,0
6,Aerodynamics of the hovering hummingbird,"Despite profound musculoskeletal differences, hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are widely thought to employ aerodynamic mechanisms similar to those used by insects. The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size. This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests. Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that they may operate at Reynolds numbers sufficiently low to exploit a key mechanism typical of insect hovering. Hummingbird hovering approaches that of insects, yet remains distinct because of effects resulting from an inherently dissimilar—avian—body plan.",10.1038/nature03647,['Move'],actively_move_liquids,no_match,attach_temporarily,0.6631464867746173,0.20371198447335817,0.20371198447335817,0,0,0
7,Capillarity-based switchable adhesion,"Drawing inspiration from the adhesion abilities of a leaf beetle found in nature, we have engineered a switchable adhesion device. The device combines two concepts: The surface tension force from a large number of small liquid bridges can be significant (capillarity-based adhesion) and these contacts can be quickly made or broken with electronic control (switchable). The device grabs or releases a substrate in a fraction of a second via a low-voltage pulse that drives electroosmotic flow. Energy consumption is minimal because both the grabbed and released states are stable equilibria that persist with no energy added to the system. Notably, the device maintains the integrity of an array of hundreds to thousands of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back, despite the natural tendency of the liquid toward coalescence. We demonstrate the scaling of adhesion strength with the inverse of liquid contact size. This suggests that strengths approaching those of permanent bonding adhesives are possible as feature size is scaled down. In addition, controllability is fast and efficient because the attachment time and required voltage also scale down favorably. The device features compact size, no solid moving parts, and is made of common materials.",10.1073/pnas.0914720107,['Attach'],actively_move_gases,actively_move_liquids,actively_move_liquids,0.3065294026721871,0.2662578403122664,0.26577665901522257,0,0,0
8,Ballistic tongue projection in chameleons maintains high performance at low temperature,"Environmental temperature impacts the physical activity and ecology of ectothermic animals through its effects on muscle contractile physiology. Sprinting, swimming, and jumping performance of ectotherms decreases by at least 33% over a 10 °C drop, accompanied by a similar decline in muscle power. We propose that ballistic movements that are powered by recoil of elastic tissues are less thermally dependent than movements that rely on direct muscular power. We found that an elastically powered movement, ballistic tongue projection in chameleons, maintains high performance over a 20 °C range. Peak velocity and power decline by only 10%–19% with a 10 °C drop, compared to >42% for nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction. These results indicate that the elastic recoil mechanism circumvents the constraints that low temperature imposes on muscle rate properties and thereby reduces the thermal dependence of tongue projection. We propose that organisms that use elastic recoil mechanisms for ecologically important movements such as feeding and locomotion may benefit from an expanded thermal niche.",10.1073/pnas.0910778107,"['Maintain structural integrity', 'Move']",protect_from_radiation,actively_move_solids,actively_move_gases,0.6950101137498073,0.16066956614117323,0.1458308925373178,0,0,0
9,Shark-skin surfaces for fluid-drag reduction in turbulent flow: a review,"The skin of fast-swimming sharks exhibits riblet structures aligned in the direction of flow that are known to reduce skin friction drag in the turbulent-flow regime. Structures have been fabricated for study and application that replicate and improve upon the natural shape of the shark-skin riblets, providing a maximum drag reduction of nearly 10 per cent. Mechanisms of fluid drag in turbulent flow and riblet-drag reduction theories from experiment and simulation are discussed. A review of riblet-performance studies is given, and optimal riblet geometries are defined. A survey of studies experimenting with riblet-topped shark-scale replicas is also given. A method for selecting optimal riblet dimensions based on fluid-flow characteristics is detailed, and current manufacturing techniques are outlined. Due to the presence of small amounts of mucus on the skin of a shark, it is expected that the localized application of hydrophobic materials will alter the flow field around the riblets in some way beneficial to the goals of increased drag reduction.",10.1098/rsta.2010.0201,['Move'],actively_move_solids,attach_temporarily,actively_move_liquids,0.6039779897738632,0.26577665901522257,0.26577665901522257,0,0,0
10,Spontaneous unraveling of hagfish slime thread skeins is mediated by a seawater-soluble protein adhesive,"Hagfishes are known for their ability to rapidly produce vast quantities of slime when provoked. The slime is formed via the interaction between seawater and two components released by the slime glands: mucin vesicles from gland mucous cells, which swell and rupture in seawater to form a network of mucus strands, and intermediate filament-rich threads, which are produced within gland thread cells as tightly coiled bundles called skeins. A previous study showed that the unraveling of skeins from Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) requires both the presence of mucins and hydrodynamic mixing. In contrast, skeins from Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) unravel in the absence of both mucins and mixing. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous unraveling of E. stoutii skeins is triggered by the dissolution of a seawater-soluble protein adhesive and the release of stored strain energy within the coiled thread. Here we show that, as predicted by this hypothesis, unraveling can be initiated by a protease under conditions in which unraveling does not normally occur. We also demonstrate, using high resolution scanning electron microscopy, that the treatment of skeins with solutions that cause unraveling also leads to the disappearance of surface and inter-thread features that remain when skeins are washed with stabilizing solutions. Our study provides a mechanism for the deployment of thread skeins in Pacific hagfish slime, and raises the possibility of producing novel biomimetic protein adhesives that are salt, temperature and kosmotrope sensitive.",10.1242/jeb.096909,"['Change size or color', 'Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",actively_move_gases,actively_move_liquids,actively_move_liquids,0.3065294026721871,0.2662578403122664,0.26577665901522257,0,0,0
11,Comparative jet wake structure and swimming performance of salps,"SUMMARY Salps are barrel-shaped marine invertebrates that swim by jet propulsion. Morphological variations among species and life-cycle stages are accompanied by differences in swimming mode. The goal of this investigation was to compare propulsive jet wakes and swimming performance variables among morphologically distinct salp species (Pegea confoederata, Weelia (Salpa) cylindrica, Cyclosalpa sp.) and relate swimming patterns to ecological function. Using a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. Locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion. The slow-swimming P. confoederata produced the highest weight-specific thrust (T=53 N kg–1) and swam with the highest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=55%). The fast-swimming W. cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an intermediate weight-specific thrust (T=30 N kg–1) and swam with an intermediate whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=52%). Weak swimming performance variables in the slow-swimming C. affinis, including the lowest weight-specific thrust (T=25 N kg–1) and lowest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=47%), may be compensated by low energetic requirements. Swimming performance variables are considered in the context of ecological roles and evolutionary relationships.",10.1242/jeb.041962,['Move'],protect_from_radiation,attach_temporarily,actively_move_liquids,0.6950101137498073,0.31243405018155596,0.26577665901522257,0,0,0
12,Underwater locomotion in a terrestrial beetle: combination of surface de-wetting and capillary forces,"For the first time, we report the remarkable ability of the terrestrial leaf beetle Gastrophysa viridula to walk on solid substrates under water. These beetles have adhesive setae on their feet that produce a secretory fluid having a crucial role in adhesion on land. In air, adhesion is produced by capillary forces between the fluid-covered setae and the substrate. In general, capillary forces do not contribute to adhesion under water. However, our observations showed that these beetles may use air bubbles trapped between their adhesive setae to walk on flooded, inclined substrata or even under water. Beetle adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces under water was lower than that in air, whereas adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces under water was comparable to that in air. Oil-covered hairy pads had a pinning effect, retaining the air bubbles on their feet. Bubbles in contact with the hydrophobic substrate de-wetted the substrate and produced capillary adhesion. Additional capillary forces are generated by the pad's liquid bridges between the foot and the substrate. Inspired by this idea, we designed an artificial silicone polymer structure with underwater adhesive properties.",10.1098/rspb.2012.1297,"['Attach', 'Move']",protect_from_radiation,actively_move_solids,actively_move_gases,0.6950101137498073,0.16066956614117323,0.1458308925373178,0,0,0
13,Dynamics of leg muscle function in tammar wallabies (M. eugenii) during level versus incline hopping,"SUMMARY The goal of our study was to examine whether the in vivo force-length behavior, work and elastic energy savings of distal muscle-tendon units in the legs of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) change during level versus incline hopping. To address this question, we obtained measurements of muscle activation (via electromyography), fascicle strain (via sonomicrometry) and muscle-tendon force (via tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined (10°, 17.4% grade) treadmill at two speeds (3.3 m s-1 and 4.2 m s-1). Similar patterns of muscle activation, force and fascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions. This also corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement (duty factor, limb contact time and hopping frequency). During both level and incline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch and shortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain [LG: level, -1.0±4.6% (mean ± s.e.m.) vs incline, 0.6±4.5%; PL: level, 0.1±1.0% vs incline, 0.4±1.6%] and muscle work (LG: level, -8.4±8.4 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -6.8±7.5 J kg-1 muscle; PL: level, -2.0±0.6 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -1.4±0.7 J kg-1 muscle). Consequently, neither muscle significantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during incline hopping. Whereas electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration and intensity did not differ for the LG, the PL exhibited shorter but more intense periods of activation, together with reduced EMG phase (P<0.01), during incline versus level hopping. Our results indicate that design for spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby, and the need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.",10.1242/jeb.00764,"['Move', 'Process resources']",protect_from_radiation,actively_move_solids,actively_move_gases,0.6950101137498073,0.16066956614117323,0.1458308925373178,0,0,0
14,Three-dimensional flow and lift characteristics of a hovering ruby-throated hummingbird,"A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation is performed for a ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) in hovering flight. Realistic wing kinematics are adopted in the numerical model by reconstructing the wing motion from high-speed imaging data of the bird. Lift history and the three-dimensional flow pattern around the wing in full stroke cycles are captured in the simulation. Significant asymmetry is observed for lift production within a stroke cycle. In particular, the downstroke generates about 2.5 times as much vertical force as the upstroke, a result that confirms the estimate based on the measurement of the circulation in a previous experimental study. Associated with lift production is the similar power imbalance between the two half strokes. Further analysis shows that in addition to the angle of attack, wing velocity and surface area, drag-based force and wing–wake interaction also contribute significantly to the lift asymmetry. Though the wing–wake interaction could be beneficial for lift enhancement, the isolated stroke simulation shows that this benefit is buried by other opposing effects, e.g. presence of downwash. The leading-edge vortex is stable during the downstroke but may shed during the upstroke. Finally, the full-body simulation result shows that the effects of wing–wing interaction and wing–body interaction are small.",10.1098/rsif.2014.0541,['Move'],actively_move_liquids,no_match,attach_temporarily,0.6631464867746173,0.20371198447335817,0.20371198447335817,0,0,0
15,Entrapment of bed bugs by leaf trichomes inspires microfabrication of biomimetic surfaces,"Resurgence in bed bug infestations and widespread pesticide resistance have greatly renewed interest in the development of more sustainable, environmentally friendly methods to manage bed bugs. Historically, in Eastern Europe, bed bugs were entrapped by leaves from bean plants, which were then destroyed; this purely physical entrapment was related to microscopic hooked hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surfaces. Using scanning electron microscopy and videography, we documented the capture mechanism: the physical impaling of bed bug feet (tarsi) by these trichomes. This is distinct from a Velcro-like mechanism of non-piercing entanglement, which only momentarily holds the bug without sustained capture. Struggling, trapped bed bugs are impaled by trichomes on several legs and are unable to free themselves. Only specific, mechanically vulnerable locations on the bug tarsi are pierced by the trichomes, which are located at effective heights and orientations for bed bug entrapment despite a lack of any evolutionary association. Using bean leaves as templates, we microfabricated surfaces indistinguishable in geometry from the real leaves, including the trichomes, using polymers with material properties similar to plant cell walls. These synthetic surfaces snag the bed bugs temporarily but do not hinder their locomotion as effectively as real leaves.",10.1098/rsif.2013.0174,"['Process resources', 'Protect from harm']",protect_from_radiation,actively_move_solids,actively_move_gases,0.6950101137498073,0.16066956614117323,0.1458308925373178,0,0,0
16,Cross-linking by protein oxidation in the rapidly setting gel-based glues of slugs,"SUMMARY The terrestrial slug Arion subfuscus secretes a glue that is a dilute gel with remarkable adhesive and cohesive strength. The function of this glue depends on metals, raising the possibility that metal-catalyzed oxidation plays a role. The extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups. Several proteins, particularly one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 165×103, were heavily oxidized. Of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non-adhesive mucus, only specific size variants were oxidized. The oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion. Although carbonyls were detected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in denatured proteins, they were not easily detected in the native state. The presence of reversible cross-links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride, which would reduce uncross-linked carbonyls to alcohols, but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes. Consistent with imine bond formation, sodium borohydride led to a 20–35% decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a Mr of 40–165 (×103) without changing the carbonyl content per protein. In contrast, the nucleophile hydroxylamine, which would competitively disrupt imine bonds, increased protein solubility in the glue. Finally, the primary amine groups on a protein with a Mr of 15×103 were not accessible to acid anhydrides. The results suggest that cross-links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue.",10.1242/jeb.051581,['Attach'],protect_from_temperature,attach_permanently,attach_temporarily,0.9998235211629595,0.0005583665375775179,1.0424747080957276e-07,0,0,0
17,Thermoregulation during Flight: Body Temperature and Sensible Heat Transfer in Free-Ranging Brazilian Free-Tailed Bats (Tadarida brasiliensis),"Bat wings are important for thermoregulation, but their role in heat balance during flight is largely unknown. More than 80% of the energy consumed during flight generates heat as a by-product, and thus it is expected that bat wings should dissipate large amounts of heat to prevent hyperthermia. We measured rectal (Tr) and surface (Ts) temperatures of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) as they emerged from and returned to their daytime roosts and calculated sensible heat transfer for different body regions (head, body, wings, and tail membrane). Bats’ Tr decreased from 36.8°C during emergence flights to 34.4°C during returns, and Ts scaled positively with ambient temperature (Ta). Total radiative heat loss from bats was significantly greater for a radiative sink to the night sky than for a sink with temperature equal to Ta. We found that free-ranging Brazilian free-tailed bats, on average, do not dissipate heat from their wings by convection but instead dissipate radiative heat (L) to the cloudless night sky during flight ( W). However, within the range of Ta measured in this study, T. brasiliensis experienced net heat loss between evening emergence and return flights. Regional hypothermia reduces heat loss from wings that are exposed to potentially high convective fluxes. Additional research is needed to establish the role of wings in evaporative cooling during flight in bats.",10.1086/657253,['Protect from harm'],actively_move_solids,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.9865851723288571,0.015317491207777315,0.0037895429506330717,1,1,1

Wind is a significant source of energy for powering nest ventilation, despite the mound being a completely enclosed structure. Nests are ventilated by a tidal movement of air driven by temporal variation in wind speed and wind direction. Density gradients sufficiently steep to drive bulk flow by natural convection will be rare. However, metabolism‐induced buoyant forces may interact with wind energy in a way that promotes homeostasis of the mound atmosphere.",10.1086/323990,['Process resources'],actively_move_solids,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.7934393015171887,0.09445764370706496,0.04698256298873829,1,1,1
19,Hydrogen and bioenergetics in the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem.,"The geochemical energy budgets for high-temperature microbial ecosystems such as occur at Yellowstone National Park have been unclear. To address the relative contributions of different geochemistries to the energy demands of these ecosystems, we draw together three lines of inference. We studied the phylogenetic compositions of high-temperature (>70 degrees C) communities in Yellowstone hot springs with distinct chemistries, conducted parallel chemical analyses, and carried out thermodynamic modeling. Results of extensive molecular analyses, taken with previous results, show that most microbial biomass in these systems, as reflected by rRNA gene abundance, is comprised of organisms of the kinds that derive energy for primary productivity from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, H2. The apparent dominance by H2-metabolizing organisms indicates that H2 is the main source of energy for primary production in the Yellowstone high-temperature ecosystem. Hydrogen concentrations in the hot springs were measured and found to range up to >300 nM, consistent with this hypothesis. Thermodynamic modeling with environmental concentrations of potential energy sources also is consistent with the proposed microaerophilic, hydrogen-based energy economy for this geothermal ecosystem, even in the presence of high concentrations of sulfide.",10.1073/pnas.0409574102,"['Maintain ecological community', 'Chemically modify or Change energy state']",actively_move_solids,attach_temporarily,actively_move_liquids,0.5500385682691387,0.22587969524958648,0.22587969524958648,1,1,1
20,Geographical Variation in Bill Size across Bird Species Provides Evidence for Allen’s Rule,"Allen’s rule proposes that the appendages of endotherms are smaller, relative to body size, in colder climates, in order to reduce heat loss. Empirical support for Allen’s rule is mainly derived from occasional reports of geographical clines in extremity size of individual species. Interspecific evidence is restricted to two studies of leg proportions in seabirds and shorebirds. We used phylogenetic comparative analyses of 214 bird species to examine whether bird bills, significant sites of heat exchange, conform to Allen’s rule. The species comprised eight diverse taxonomic groups—toucans, African barbets, Australian parrots, estrildid finches, Canadian galliforms, penguins, gulls, and terns. Across all species, there were strongly significant relationships between bill length and both latitude and environmental temperature, with species in colder climates having significantly shorter bills. Patterns supporting Allen’s rule in relation to latitudinal or altitudinal distribution held within all groups except the finches. Evidence for a direct association with temperature was found within four groups (parrots, galliforms, penguins, and gulls). Support for Allen’s rule in leg elements was weaker, suggesting that bird bills may be more susceptible to thermoregulatory constraints generally. Our results provide the strongest comparative support yet published for Allen’s rule and demonstrate that thermoregulation has been an important factor in shaping the evolution of bird bills.",10.1086/653666,"['Physically assemble/disassemble', 'Protect from harm']",actively_move_solids,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.7934393015171887,0.09445764370706496,0.04698256298873829,1,1,1
21,Impact behaviour of freeze-dried and fresh pomelo (Citrus maxima) peel: influence of the hydration state,"Pomelos (Citrus maxima) are known for their thick peel which—inter alia—serves as energy dissipator when fruits impact on the ground after being shed. It protects the fruit from splitting open and thus enables the contained seeds to stay germinable and to potentially be dispersed by animal vectors. The main part of the peel consists of a parenchymatous tissue that can be interpreted from a materials point of view as open pored foam whose struts are pressurized and filled with liquid. In order to investigate the influence of the water content on the energy dissipation capacity, drop weight tests were conducted with fresh and with freeze-dried peel samples. Based on the coefficient of restitution it was found that freeze-drying markedly reduces the relative energy dissipation capacity of the peel. Measuring the transmitted force during impact furthermore indicated a transition from a uniform collapse of the foam-like tissue to a progressive collapse due to water extraction. Representing the peel by a Maxwell model illustrates that freeze-drying not only drastically reduces the damping function of the dashpots but also stiffens the springs of the model.",10.1098/rsos.140322,['Maintain structural integrity'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_radiation,protect_from_ice,0.9178653793715609,0.09968061060838307,0.035223382953338586,2,2,2
22,Macroevolutionary assembly of ant/plant symbioses: Pseudomyrmex ants and their ant-housing plants in the Neotropics,"Symbioses include some of the clearest cases of coevolution, but their origin, loss or reassembly with different partners can rarely be inferred. Here we use ant/plant symbioses involving three plant clades to investigate the evolution of symbioses. We generated phylogenies for the big-eyed arboreal ants (Pseudomyrmecinae), including 72% of their 286 species, as well as for five of their plant host groups, in each case sampling more than 61% of the species. We show that the ant-housing Vachellia (Mimosoideae) clade and its ants co-diversified for the past 5 Ma, with some species additionally colonized by younger plant-nesting ant species, some parasitic. An apparent co-radiation of ants and Tachigali (Caesalpinioideae) was followed by waves of colonization by the same ant clade, and subsequent occupation by a younger ant group. Wide crown and stem age differences between the ant-housing genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) and its obligate ant inhabitants, and stochastic trait mapping, indicate that its domatium evolved earlier than the ants now occupying it, suggesting previous symbioses that dissolved. Parasitic ant species evolved from generalists, not from mutualists, and are younger than the mutualistic systems they parasitize. Our study illuminates the macroevolutionary assembly of ant/plant symbioses, which has been highly dynamic, even in very specialized systems.",10.1098/rspb.2015.2200,['Protect from harm'],protect_from_ice,regulate_drag_turbulence,compete_within_between_species,0.8511341503469162,0.13790715030885908,0.12451595871410741,2,2,2
23,Penguin heat-retention structures evolved in a greenhouse Earth,"Penguins (Sphenisciformes) inhabit some of the most extreme environments on Earth. The 60+ Myr fossil record of penguins spans an interval that witnessed dramatic shifts in Cenozoic ocean temperatures and currents, indicating a long interplay between penguin evolution and environmental change. Perhaps the most celebrated example is the successful Late Cenozoic invasion of glacial environments by crown clade penguins. A major adaptation that allows penguins to forage in cold water is the humeral arterial plexus, a vascular counter-current heat exchanger (CCHE) that limits heat loss through the flipper. Fossil evidence reveals that the humeral plexus arose at least 49 Ma during a ‘Greenhouse Earth’ interval. The evolution of the CCHE is therefore unrelated to global cooling or development of polar ice sheets, but probably represents an adaptation to foraging in subsurface waters at temperate latitudes. As global climate cooled, the CCHE was key to invasion of thermally more demanding environments associated with Antarctic ice sheets.",10.1098/rsbl.2010.0993,['Protect from harm'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
24,"Deep supercooling, vitrification and limited survival to –100°C in the Alaskan beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) larvae","SUMMARY Larvae of the freeze-avoiding beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) in Alaska have mean supercooling points in winter of –35 to –42°C, with the lowest supercooling point recorded for an individual of –58°C. We previously noted that some larvae did not freeze when cooled to –80°C, and we speculated that these larvae vitrified. Here we present evidence through differential scanning calorimetry that C. c. puniceus larvae transition into a glass-like state at temperatures <–58°C and can avoid freezing to at least –150°C. This novel finding adds vitrification to the list of insect overwintering strategies. While overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, C. c. puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around –40°C (and lower) when microhabitat is un-insulated because of low snow cover. Decreasing temperatures in winter are correlated with loss of body water from summer high levels near 2.0 to winter lows near 0.4 mg mg–1 dry mass and concomitant increases in glycerol concentrations (4–6 mol l–1) and thermal hysteresis. Finally, we provide direct evidence that Cucujus from Wiseman, Alaska, survive temperatures to –100°C.",10.1242/jeb.035758,['Protect from harm'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_radiation,protect_from_ice,0.999995858807473,1.1262109896082299e-05,2.7544946768016995e-06,2,2,2
25,"Super-lampreys and wave energy: Optimised control of artificially-evolved, simulated swimming lamprey","Propulsion in the lamprey, an eel-like fish, is governed by activity in its spinal neural network (called a central pattern generator (CPG)). This CPG is simulated, in accordance with Ekeberg's original model, and optimised alternatives are generated with genetic algorithms (GAs). A two-phase GA is adopted: (1) to evolve neuron-descriptive parameters and synaptic weights of the neural oscillator for a single lamprey segment, (2) to generate interconnections between segments. Results demonstrate that Ekeberg's prototype is not a unique solution and that simpler versions with wider operational ranges can be generated. Evolved solutions outperform the swimming capabilities of a modelled biological organism, as an initial step in understanding how to control wave power devices, with similar motion to the lamprey.",10.1016/j.neucom.2006.11.013,"['Move', 'Sense send or process information']",protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
26,Electrical and behavioral courtship displays in the mormyrid fish Brienomyrus brachyistius,"SUMMARY Mormyrid electric fish rely on the waveform of their electric organ discharges (EODs) for communicating species, sex, and social status, while they use the sequences of pulse intervals (SPIs) for communicating rapidly changing behavioral states and motivation. Little is known of electric signaling during courtship behavior because of two major difficulties: (1) the fish are not easily bred in captivity and (2) there is no reliable means of separating electric signals from several individuals in natural communication settings. Through simulating artificial rain conditions, we have successfully induced courtship and succeeded in breeding a mormyrid electric fish (Brienomyrus brachyistius) in the laboratory. We have also developed a system of video recording and editing combined with cross correlation analysis to precisely record and view behavior and separate EODs from two individuals in non-breeding and breeding contexts. Knowing the electrical and motor patterns during courtship allows for further exploration of topics such as mate choice and neural basis of pattern generation in these fish. Here we describe nine common motor displays and 11 SPIs. Analysis of frequency of occurrences suggests that some SPI patterns are sex and season specific. We also observed electrical duetting called `rasp matching' during courtship signaling among pairs; males and females exchange `rasps' and `bursts', respectively, in alternation. Our study employs new techniques to separate and document SPIs in the context of courtship. We show that some SPIs correlate with specific behavioral acts around the time of spawning.",10.1242/jeb.003509,['Sense send or process information'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
27,How Archer Fish Achieve a Powerful Impact: Hydrodynamic Instability of a Pulsed Jet in Toxotes jaculatrix,"Archer fish knock down insects anchored to vegetation by hitting them with a precisely aimed jet of water. The striking force of the jet at the impact is such to overcome the strong anchoring forces of insects. The origin of the effectiveness of such hunting mechanism has been long searched for inside of the fish, in the unsuccessful attempt to identify internal structures dedicated to the amplification of muscular power. Here we perform a kinematic analysis of the jet emitted by two specimens of Toxotes jaculatrix. We estimate that at the impact the jet conveys a typical specific power of about 3000 W/kg, which is well above the maximum specific power of the order of 500 W/kg deliverable by a vertebrate muscle. Unexpectedly, we find that the amplification of muscular power occurs outside of the fish, and is due to a hydrodynamic instability of the jet akin to those occurring in Drop-on-Demand inkjet printing. The investigated fish are found to modulate the velocity of the jet at the orifice to favor the formation of a single, large, water drop that hits the prey abruptly with a large momentum. The observed mechanism represents a remarkable example of use of an external hydrodynamic lever that does possibly not entail the high evolutionary cost needed for the development of highly specialized internal structures dedicated to the storing of mechanical energy.",10.1371/journal.pone.0047867,['Process resources'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
28,Protein Oxidation Implicated as the Primary Determinant of Bacterial Radioresistance,"In the hierarchy of cellular targets damaged by ionizing radiation (IR), classical models of radiation toxicity place DNA at the top. Yet, many prokaryotes are killed by doses of IR that cause little DNA damage. Here we have probed the nature of Mn-facilitated IR resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans, which together with other extremely IR-resistant bacteria have high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios compared to IR-sensitive bacteria. For in vitro and in vivo irradiation, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between Mn(II) ions and protection of proteins from oxidative modifications that introduce carbonyl groups. Conditions that inhibited Mn accumulation or Mn redox cycling rendered D. radiodurans radiation sensitive and highly susceptible to protein oxidation. X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis showed that Mn is globally distributed in D. radiodurans, but Fe is sequestered in a region between dividing cells. For a group of phylogenetically diverse IR-resistant and IR-sensitive wild-type bacteria, our findings support the idea that the degree of resistance is determined by the level of oxidative protein damage caused during irradiation. We present the case that protein, rather than DNA, is the principal target of the biological action of IR in sensitive bacteria, and extreme resistance in Mn-accumulating bacteria is based on protein protection.",10.1371/journal.pbio.0050092,['Protect from harm'],maintain_biodiversity,actively_move_solids,no_match,0.999782646119279,0.00011795683731518775,9.364617898567843e-05,2,2,2
29,Flow-dependent porosity and other biomechanical properties of mysticete baleen,"SUMMARY Despite its vital function in a highly dynamic environment, baleen is typically assumed to be a static material. Its biomechanical and material properties have not previously been explored. Thus I tested sections of baleen from bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, alone or in groups representing miniature ‘racks’, in a flow tank through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity. Kinematic sequences were recorded through an endoscopic camera or viewing window. One set of experiments investigated particle capture; another series analyzed biomechanical behavior, including fringe spacing, movement and interaction. Baleen fringe porosity directly correlates, in a mostly linear fashion, with velocity of incident water flow. However, undulation and interaction of fringes (especially of bowheads) at higher flow velocities can decrease porosity. Fringe porosity depends on distance from the baleen plate. Porosity also varies, with fringe length, by position along the length of an individual plate. Plate orientation, which varied from 0 to 90 deg relative to water flow, is crucial in fringe spacing and particle capture. At all flow velocities, porosity is lowest with plates aligned parallel to water flow. Turbulence introduced when plates rotate perpendicular to flow (as in cross-flow filtration) increases fringe interaction, so that particles more easily strike fringes yet more readily dislodge. Baleen of bowhead whales, which feed by continuous ram filtration, differs biomechanically from that of humpbacks, which use intermittent lunge filtration. The longer, finer fringes of bowhead baleen readily form a mesh-like mat, especially at higher flow velocities, to trap tiny particles.",10.1242/jeb.078931,['Process resources'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
30,Molecular Basis of Infrared Detection by Snakes,"Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation, enabling them to generate a ‘thermal image’ of predators or prey. Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.",10.1038/nature08943,['Sense send or process information'],protect_from_ice,regulate_drag_turbulence,compete_within_between_species,0.8511341503469162,0.13790715030885908,0.12451595871410741,2,2,2
31,How ants use quorum sensing to estimate the average quality of a fluctuating resource,"We show that one of the advantages of quorum-based decision-making is an ability to estimate the average value of a resource that fluctuates in quality. By using a quorum threshold, namely the number of ants within a new nest site, to determine their choice, the ants are in effect voting with their feet. Our results show that such quorum sensing is compatible with homogenization theory such that the average value of a new nest site is determined by ants accumulating within it when the nest site is of high quality and leaving when it is poor. Hence, the ants can estimate a surprisingly accurate running average quality of a complex resource through the use of extraordinarily simple procedures.",10.1038/srep11890,['Maintain ecological community'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
32,THE Absorption of Water by Woodlice,"1. Experiments were undertaken to determine the site of water uptake, and the conditions in which it occurs, in Ligia oceanica, Oniscus asellus, Porcellio scaber and Armadillidium vulgare.2. Besides absorbing water with moist food, all four species were capable of active imbibition of water through both mouth and anus when a free water surface was available. In Ligia oceanica, imbibition occurred largely through the anus, in other species, through the mouth. Absorption through the anus was demonstrated by blocking the mouth by electro-cautery.3. All species save L. oceanica could imbibe water through the mouth from a damp surface (plaster of Paris) sufficiently rapidly to counteract the effect of transpiration from the integument in air at c. 85 % R.H. No water was absorbed through the anus in these conditions.4. The results help to resolve certain conflicting statements regarding the distribution of different species in the field. All species are for the most part ‘wet living’, but they differ as regards tolerance of suboptimal conditions.",10.1242/jeb.31.4.491,['Process resources'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
33,A nonprotein thermal hysteresis-producing xylomannan antifreeze in the freeze-tolerant Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides,"Thermal hysteresis (TH), a difference between the melting and freezing points of a solution that is indicative of the presence of large-molecular-mass antifreezes (e.g., antifreeze proteins), has been described in animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi. Although all previously described TH-producing biomolecules are proteins, most thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) have not yet been structurally characterized, and none have been characterized from a freeze-tolerant animal. We isolated a highly active THF from the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, by means of ice affinity. Amino acid chromatographic analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the THF contained little or no protein, yet it produced 3.7 ± 0.3 °C of TH at 5 mg/ml, comparable to that of the most active insect antifreeze proteins. Compositional and structural analyses indicated that this antifreeze contains a β-mannopyranosyl-(1→4) β-xylopyranose backbone and a fatty acid component, although the lipid may not be covalently linked to the saccharide. Consistent with the proposed structure, treatment with endo-β-(1→4)xylanase ablated TH activity. This xylomannan is the first TH-producing antifreeze isolated from a freeze-tolerant animal and the first in a new class of highly active THFs that contain little or no protein.",10.1073/pnas.0909872106,['Protect from harm'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_radiation,protect_from_ice,0.9999984747202291,2.5708565898015736e-05,1.2558403298969958e-06,2,2,2
34,Trabecular bone scales allometrically in mammals and birds,"Many bones are supported internally by a latticework of trabeculae. Scaling of whole bone length and diameter has been extensively investigated, but scaling of the trabecular network is not well characterized. We analysed trabecular geometry in the femora of 90 terrestrial mammalian and avian species with body masses ranging from 3 g to 3400 kg. We found that bone volume fraction does not scale substantially with animal size, while trabeculae in larger animals' femora are thicker, further apart and fewer per unit volume than in smaller animals. Finite element modelling indicates that trabecular scaling does not alter the bulk stiffness of trabecular bone, but does alter strain within trabeculae under equal applied loads. Allometry of bone's trabecular tissue may contribute to the skeleton's ability to withstand load, without incurring the physiological or mechanical costs of increasing bone mass.",10.1098/rspb.2011.0069,['Maintain structural integrity'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
35,Circumferential spicule growth by pericellular silica deposition in the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni,"SUMMARY The giant basal spicule of the hexactinellid sponge Monorhaphis chuni represents the longest natural siliceous structure on Earth. This spicule is composed of concentrically arranged lamellae that are approximately 10 μm thick. In the present study, we investigated the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and/or growing spicule. The cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella. The pericellular (silica) material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately 20–30 μm in diameter. The newly formed layer initially displays 40 μm wide, well-structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step. The chemical composition in the depressions was studied using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by staining with Texas Red. The data suggest that those depressions are the nests for the silica-forming cells and that silica formation starts with a direct association of silica-forming cells with the outer surface of the spicule, where they remain and initiate the development of the next lamellae.",10.1242/jeb.056275,['Physically assemble/disassemble'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
36,A Predator from East Africa that Chooses Malaria Vectors as Preferred Prey,"Background All vectors of human malaria, a disease responsible for more than one million deaths per year, are female mosquitoes from the genus Anopheles. Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider (Salticidae) that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selecting blood-carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey. Methodology/Principal Findings By testing with motionless lures made from mounting dead insects in lifelike posture on cork discs, we show that E. culicivora selects Anopheles mosquitoes in preference to other mosquitoes and that this predator can identify Anopheles by static appearance alone. Tests using active (grooming) virtual mosquitoes rendered in 3-D animation show that Anopheles' characteristic resting posture is an important prey-choice cue for E. culicivora. Expression of the spider's preference for Anopheles varies with the spider's size, varies with its prior feeding condition and is independent of the spider gaining a blood meal. Conclusions/Significance This is the first experimental study to show that a predator of any type actively chooses Anopheles as preferred prey, suggesting that specialized predators having a role in the biological control of disease vectors is a realistic possibility.",10.1371/journal.pone.0000132,"['Process resources', 'Maintain ecological community']",protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
37,"The hummingbird tongue is a fluid trap, not a capillary tube","Hummingbird tongues pick up a liquid, calorie-dense food that cannot be grasped, a physical challenge that has long inspired the study of nectar-transport mechanics. Existing biophysical models predict optimal hummingbird foraging on the basis of equations that assume that fluid rises through the tongue in the same way as through capillary tubes. We demonstrate that the hummingbird tongue does not function like a pair of tiny, static tubes drawing up floral nectar via capillary action. Instead, we show that the tongue tip is a dynamic liquid-trapping device that changes configuration and shape dramatically as it moves in and out of fluids. We also show that the tongue–fluid interactions are identical in both living and dead birds, demonstrating that this mechanism is a function of the tongue structure itself, and therefore highly efficient because no energy expenditure by the bird is required to drive the opening and closing of the trap. Our results rule out previous conclusions from capillarity-based models of nectar feeding and highlight the necessity of developing a new biophysical model for nectar intake in hummingbirds. Our findings have ramifications for the study of feeding mechanics in other nectarivorous birds, and for the understanding of the evolution of nectarivory in general. We propose a conceptual mechanical explanation for this unique fluid-trapping capacity, with far-reaching practical applications (e.g., biomimetics).",10.1073/pnas.1016944108,['Process resources'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
38,Radular teeth as models for the improvement of industrial cutting devices,"Limpets (Gastropoda) and chitons (Polyplacophora) feed on epi- and endolithic organisms by means of the radula, a specialized feeding apparatus located in the mouth cavity. The radula owes most of its abrasive capability to the presence of numerous mineralized teeth. Here we report on the shape, internal structure, wearing pattern, feeding position, and distribution of hardness and elastic properties of these teeth in an attempt to generate ideas for the innovation of industrial cutting devices. The teeth remain sharp during their entire working-life mainly due to the fact that wearing preferentially occurs along surfaces formed by the internal structure of the tooth. It is shown that shape, internal structure, positioning and material characteristics concertedly function in minimizing the rate at which the teeth wear down and in maintaining optimal cutting behaviour. Implementation of these self-sharpening characteristics into industrial cutting devices is discussed.",10.1016/S0928-4931(99)00129-0,['Physically assemble/disassemble'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
39,Daily variation in cellular content of UV-absorbing compounds mycosporine-like amino acids in the marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae.,"Sudden exposure experiments to high PAR (photosynthetically available radiation) or high PAR+UVR (ultraviolet radiation) were conducted for the marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae acclimated to either low PAR or high PAR to determine the induction of cellular mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) in relation to photosynthesis status. When the exposure to high PAR (30.8 Wm(-2)) was provided at different time in the light period for S. sweeneyae acclimated to low PAR (7.7 Wm(-2)) which suppressed photosynthesis, S. sweeneyae could enhance the induction of MAA but it only occurred in the first half of the light period. When UVR exposure was provided for the culture acclimated to high PAR which enhanced photosynthesis, cellular MAA content did not increase during the entire light period, but displayed daily variation similar to the control for two and half days. Daily variation of cellular MAA content did not synchronized with that of cell volume and cellular chlorophyll a content. The individual MAAs also revealed similar daily variations with different phase, which increased for a few hours in the beginning of the light period, except for cellular palythine content. Thus the total cellular MAA content revealed daily variation with changing the relative composition within a few hours. As one of the biological protective strategies against harmful UVR in sunlight, the daily vertical migration in the bloom forming dinoflagellates might be accompanied by the daily variation of cellular MAA content for a photosynthesis at daytime.",10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2004.06.002,['Protect from harm'],protect_from_ice,change_structural_color,maintain_biodiversity,0.8511341503469162,0.23670533980128977,0.2249832074183038,2,2,2
40,Adhesion forces measured at the level of a terminal plate of the fly's seta,"The attachment pads of fly legs are covered with setae, each ending in small terminal plates coated with secretory fluid. A cluster of these terminal plates contacting a substrate surface generates strong attractive forces that hold the insect on smooth surfaces. Previous research assumed that cohesive forces and molecular adhesion were involved in the fly attachment mechanism. The main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force, however, remained unknown. Multiple local force–volume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy. It was shown that the geometry of a single terminal plate had a higher border and considerably lower centre. Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad. Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force. Our data provide the first direct evidence that, in addition to Van der Waals and Coulomb forces, attractive capillary forces, mediated by pad secretion, are a critical factor in the fly's attachment mechanism.",10.1098/rspb.2004.2850,['Attach'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
41,Structural Design and Biomechanics of Friction-Based Releasable Attachment Devices in Insects1,"Abstract Design of attachment devices in insects varies enormously in relation to different functional loads. Many systems, located on different parts of the body, involve surfaces with particular frictional properties. Such systems evolved to attach parts of the body to each other, or to attach an insect to the substratum by providing fast and reversible attachment/detachment. Among these systems, there are some that deal with predefined surfaces, and others, in which one surface remains unpredictable. The first type of system occurs, for example, in wing-locking devices and head-arresting systems and is called probabilistic fasteners. The second type is mainly represented by insect attachment pads of two alternative designs: hairy and smooth. The relationship between surface patterns and/or mechanical properties of materials of contact pairs results in two main working principles of the frictional devices: mechanical interlocking, or maximization of the contact area. We give an overview of the functional design of two main groups of friction-based attachment devices in insects: probabilistic fasteners and attachment pads.",10.1093/icb/42.6.1127,['Attach'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
42,Slippery surfaces of pitcher plants: Nepenthes wax crystals minimize insect attachment via microscopic surface roughness,"SUMMARY Pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes efficiently trap and retain insect prey in highly specialized leaves. Besides a slippery peristome which inhibits adhesion of insects they employ epicuticular wax crystals on the inner walls of the conductive zone of the pitchers to hamper insect attachment by adhesive devices. It has been proposed that the detachment of individual crystals and the resulting contamination of adhesive organs is responsible for capturing insects. However, our results provide evidence in favour of a different mechanism, mainly based on the stability and the roughness of the waxy surface. First, we were unable to detect a large quantity of crystal fragments on the pads of insects detached from mature pitcher surfaces of Nepenthes alata. Second, investigation of the pitcher surface by focused ion beam treatment showed that the wax crystals form a compact 3D structure. Third, atomic force microscopy of the platelet-shaped crystals revealed that the crystals are mechanically stable, rendering crystal detachment by insect pads unlikely. Fourth, the surface profile parameters of the wax layer showed striking similarities to those of polishing paper with low grain size. By measuring friction forces of insects on this artificial surface we demonstrate that microscopic roughness alone is sufficient to minimize insect attachment. A theoretical model shows that surface roughness within a certain length scale will prevent adhesion by being too rough for adhesive pads but not rough enough for claws.",10.1242/jeb.035618,"['Process resources', 'Attach']",no_match,protect_from_radiation,no_match,0.5420127455969074,0.2465065502089387,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
43,Passive radiative cooling below ambient air temperature under direct sunlight,"Cooling is a significant end-use of energy globally and a major driver of peak electricity demand. Air conditioning, for example, accounts for nearly fifteen per cent of the primary energy used by buildings in the United States. A passive cooling strategy that cools without any electricity input could therefore have a significant impact on global energy consumption. To achieve cooling one needs to be able to reach and maintain a temperature below that of the ambient air. At night, passive cooling below ambient air temperature has been demonstrated using a technique known as radiative cooling, in which a device exposed to the sky is used to radiate heat to outer space through a transparency window in the atmosphere between 8 and 13 micrometres. Peak cooling demand, however, occurs during the daytime. Daytime radiative cooling to a temperature below ambient of a surface under direct sunlight has not been achieved because sky access during the day results in heating of the radiative cooler by the Sun. Here, we experimentally demonstrate radiative cooling to nearly 5 degrees Celsius below the ambient air temperature under direct sunlight. Using a thermal photonic approach, we introduce an integrated photonic solar reflector and thermal emitter consisting of seven layers of HfO2 and SiO2 that reflects 97 per cent of incident sunlight while emitting strongly and selectively in the atmospheric transparency window. When exposed to direct sunlight exceeding 850 watts per square metre on a rooftop, the photonic radiative cooler cools to 4.9 degrees Celsius below ambient air temperature, and has a cooling power of 40.1 watts per square metre at ambient air temperature. These results demonstrate that a tailored, photonic approach can fundamentally enable new technological possibilities for energy efficiency. Further, the cold darkness of the Universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day.",10.1038/nature13883,"['Protect from harm', 'Sense send or process information', 'Chemically modify or Change energy state']",protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
44,Structure and mechanical behavior of a toucan beak,"Abstract The toucan beak, which comprises one third of the length of the bird and yet only about 1/20th of its mass, has outstanding stiffness. The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 μm diameter and 1 μm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 × 10−5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 × 10−3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading.",10.1016/j.actamat.2005.04.048,['Maintain structural integrity'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
45,The Venus Flytrap Dionaea muscipula Counts Prey-Induced Action Potentials to Induce Sodium Uptake,"Summary Carnivorous plants, such as the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), depend on an animal diet when grown in nutrient-poor soils. When an insect visits the trap and tilts the mechanosensors on the inner surface, action potentials (APs) are fired. After a moving object elicits two APs, the trap snaps shut, encaging the victim. Panicking preys repeatedly touch the trigger hairs over the subsequent hours, leading to a hermetically closed trap, which via the gland-based endocrine system is flooded by a prey-decomposing acidic enzyme cocktail. Here, we asked the question as to how many times trigger hairs have to be stimulated (e.g., now many APs are required) for the flytrap to recognize an encaged object as potential food, thus making it worthwhile activating the glands. By applying a series of trigger-hair stimulations, we found that the touch hormone jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway is activated after the second stimulus, while more than three APs are required to trigger an expression of genes encoding prey-degrading hydrolases, and that this expression is proportional to the number of mechanical stimulations. A decomposing animal contains a sodium load, and we have found that these sodium ions enter the capture organ via glands. We identified a flytrap sodium channel DmHKT1 as responsible for this sodium acquisition, with the number of transcripts expressed being dependent on the number of mechano-electric stimulations. Hence, the number of APs a victim triggers while trying to break out of the trap identifies the moving prey as a struggling Na+-rich animal and nutrition for the plant.

46,How swifts control their glide performance with morphing wings,"Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance. That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing’s performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts’ behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance—with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8–10 m s-1, whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15–25 m s-1. In fact, swifts spend the night (‘roost’) in flight at 8–10 m s-1 (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds’ wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.",10.1038/nature05733,['Move'],no_match,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.6137163917213377,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2

48,Wood frog adaptations to overwintering in Alaska: new limits to freezing tolerance,"We investigated the ecological physiology and behavior of free-living wood frogs [Lithobates (Rana) sylvaticus] overwintering in Interior Alaska by tracking animals into natural hibernacula, recording microclimate, and determining frog survival in spring. We measured cryoprotectant (glucose) concentrations and identified the presence of antifreeze glycolipids in tissues from subsamples of naturally freezing frogs. We also recorded the behavior of wood frogs preparing to freeze in artificial hibernacula, and tissue glucose concentrations in captive wood frogs frozen in the laboratory to −2.5°C. Wood frogs in natural hibernacula remained frozen for 193±11 consecutive days and experienced average (October–May) temperatures of −6.3°C and average minimum temperatures of −14.6±2.8°C (range −8.9 to −18.1°C) with 100% survival (N=18). Mean glucose concentrations were 13-fold higher in muscle, 10-fold higher in heart and 3.3-fold higher in liver in naturally freezing compared with laboratory frozen frogs. Antifreeze glycolipid was present in extracts from muscle and internal organs, but not skin, of frozen frogs. Wood frogs in Interior Alaska survive freezing to extreme limits and durations compared with those described in animals collected in southern Canada or the Midwestern United States. We hypothesize that this enhancement of freeze tolerance in Alaskan wood frogs is due to higher cryoprotectant levels that are produced by repeated freezing and thawing cycles experienced under natural conditions during early autumn.",10.1242/jeb.101931,['Protect from harm'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_radiation,protect_from_ice,0.9999999263267366,7.821843807686865e-05,1.7731775658306994e-07,2,2,2
49,Cold-stable eye lens crystallins of the Antarctic nototheniid toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni Norman,"SUMMARY The eye lenses of the Antarctic nototheniid fishes that inhabit the perennially freezing Antarctic seawater are transparent at –2°C, whereas the cold-sensitive mammalian and tropical fish lenses display cold-induced cataract at 20°C and 7°C, respectively. No cold-cataract occurs in the giant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni lens when cooled to temperatures as low as –12°C, indicating highly cold-stable lens proteins. To investigate this cold stability, we characterised the lens crystallin proteins of the Antarctic toothfish, in parallel with those of the sub-tropical bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus and the endothermic cow Bos taurus, representing three disparate thermal climes (–2°C, 18°C and 37°C, respectively). Sizing chromatography resolved their lens crystallins into three groups,α /βH, β and γ, with γ crystallins being the most abundant (>40%) lens proteins in fish, in contrast to the cow lens where they comprise only 19%. The upper thermal stability of these crystallin components correlated with the body temperature of the species. In vitro chaperone assays showed that fish α crystallin can protect same-species γ crystallins from heat denaturation, as well as lysozyme from DTT-induced unfolding, and therefore are small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSP) like their mammalian counterparts. Dynamic light scattering measured an increase in size of αγ crystallin mixtures upon heating, which supports formation of the αγ complex as an integral part of the chaperone process. Surprisingly, in cross-species chaperone assays, tunaα crystallins only partly protected toothfish γ crystallins, while cow α crystallins completely failed to protect, indicating partial and no αγ interaction, respectively. Toothfish γ was likely to be the component that failed to interact, as the supernatant from a cowα plus toothfish γ incubation could chaperone cow γ crystallins in a subsequent heat incubation, indicating the presence of uncomplexed cow α. This suggests that the inability of toothfish γ crystallins to fully complex with tuna α, and not at all with the cowα crystallins, may have its basis in adaptive changes in the protein that relate to the extreme cold-stability of the toothfish lens.",10.1242/jeb.01312,['Protect from harm'],protect_from_fire,protect_from_radiation,protect_from_ice,0.9178653793715609,0.09968061060838307,0.035223382953338586,2,2,2
50,Actuation systems in plants as prototypes for bioinspired devices,Plants have evolved a multitude of mechanisms to actuate organ movement. The osmotic influx and efflux of water in living cells can cause a rapid movement of organs in a predetermined direction. Even dead tissue can be actuated by a swelling or drying of the plant cell walls. The deformation of the organ is controlled at different levels of tissue hierarchy by geometrical constraints at the micrometre level (e.g. cell shape and size) and cell wall polymer composition at the nanoscale (e.g. cellulose fibril orientation). This paper reviews different mechanisms of organ movement in plants and highlights recent research in the field. Particular attention is paid to systems that are activated without any metabolism. The design principles of such systems may be particularly useful for a biomimetic translation into active technical composites and moving devices.,10.1098/rsta.2009.0003,"['Change size or color', 'Protect from harm']",protect_from_fire,protect_from_temperature,no_match,0.263212708295584,0.19532125132798947,0.18305776388421713,2,2,2
51,Tree shrew lavatories: a novel nitrogen sequestration strategy in a tropical pitcher plant,"Nepenthes pitcher plants are typically carnivorous, producing pitchers with varying combinations of epicuticular wax crystals, viscoelastic fluids and slippery peristomes to trap arthropod prey, especially ants. However, ant densities are low in tropical montane habitats, thereby limiting the potential benefits of the carnivorous syndrome. Nepenthes lowii, a montane species from Borneo, produces two types of pitchers that differ greatly in form and function. Pitchers produced by immature plants conform to the ‘typical’ Nepenthes pattern, catching arthropod prey. However, pitchers produced by mature N. lowii plants lack the features associated with carnivory and are instead visited by tree shrews, which defaecate into them after feeding on exudates that accumulate on the pitcher lid. We tested the hypothesis that tree shrew faeces represent a significant nitrogen (N) source for N. lowii, finding that it accounts for between 57 and 100 per cent of foliar N in mature N. lowii plants. Thus, N. lowii employs a diversified N sequestration strategy, gaining access to a N source that is not available to sympatric congeners. The interaction between N. lowii and tree shrews appears to be a mutualism based on the exchange of food sources that are scarce in their montane habitat.",10.1098/rsbl.2009.0311,"['Process resources', 'Maintain ecological community']",no_match,cooperate_within_between_species,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.8642994598496487,0.15466687496497963,0.1076420304064052,3,3,3
52,Induced production of antifungal naphthoquinones in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant Nepenthes khasiana,"Nepenthes spp. are carnivorous plants that have developed insect capturing traps, evolved by specific modification of the leaf tips, and are able to utilize insect degradation products as nutritional precursors. A chitin-induced antifungal ability, based on the production and secretion to the trap liquid of droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone, is described here. Such specific secretion uniquely occurred when chitin injection was used as the eliciting agent and probably reflects a certain kind of defence mechanism that has been evolved for protecting the carnivory-based provision of nutritional precursors. The pitcher liquid containing droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone at 3:1 or 4:1 molar ratio, as well as the purified naphthoquinones, exerted an antifungal effect on a wide range of plant and human fungal pathogens. When tested against Candida and Aspergillus spp., the concentrations required for achieving inhibitory and fungicidal effects were significantly lower than those causing cytotoxicity in cells of the human embryonic kidney cell line, 293T. These naturally secreted 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives, that are assumed to act via semiquinone enhancement of free radical production, may offer a new lead to develop alternative antifungal drugs with reduced selectable pressure for potentially evolved resistance.",10.1093/jxb/erp359,['Protect from harm'],no_match,protect_from_radiation,regulate_drag_turbulence,0.5180562360834949,0.2465065502089387,0.13606155170161796,3,3,3
53,Honeybee flight: a novel ‘streamlining’ response,"SUMMARY Animals that move rapidly through the air can save considerable energy by reducing the drag that they need to overcome during flight. We describe a novel ‘streamlining’ response in tethered, flying honeybees in which the abdomen is held in a raised position when the visual system is exposed to a pattern of image motion that is characteristic of forward flight. This visually evoked response, which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow, presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight. The response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect. Thus, our results also underscore the importance of using panoramic stimulation for the study of visually guided flight in insects, and reveal the relative importance of various regions of the visual field in assessing the speed of flight through the environment.",10.1242/jeb.050310,['Maintain structural integrity'],no_match,regulate_drag_turbulence,compete_within_between_species,0.9544505283649193,0.03890873741618073,0.030211928120138724,3,3,3
54,"Ultrasound-triggered, flight-gated evasive maneuvers in the praying mantis Parasphendale agrionina. II. Tethered flight","In tethered flight, Parasphendale agrionina (Gerst.) males respond to ultrasonic stimuli with a unique suite of behaviors that includes full extension of the forelegs, strong dorsiflexion of the abdomen, a head roll, a 5% decrease in wingbeat frequency and a 33% increase in forewing excursion. Latency for the foreleg extension averages 66 ms while the latency to onset of yaw is 174 ms. The direction of the turn is unrelated to the location of the speaker. Yaw magnitude and latency are only weakly related to sound pressure level, and variability in these and other parameters is high. The behavior shows moderately sharp tuning to 40–60 kHz with a lowest mean threshold of 60 dB SPL. A male will not respond to ultrasound unless in flight, and the context-gating is independent of sensory input from the tarsi. Several components of the in-flight evasive behavior resemble defensive displays on the ground, and we suggest that this mantis has responded to predation pressure from bats with both flight-derived maneuvers and an aerial deimatic display.",10.1242/jeb.152.1.41,"['Protect from harm', 'Sense send or process information']",cooperate_within_between_species,no_match,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.986244177184966,0.16195732989675227,0.10384231156318079,3,3,3
55,Plant green-island phenotype induced by leaf-miners is mediated by bacterial symbionts,"The life cycles of many organisms are constrained by the seasonality of resources. This is particularly true for leaf-mining herbivorous insects that use deciduous leaves to fuel growth and reproduction even beyond leaf fall. Our results suggest that an intimate association with bacterial endosymbionts might be their way of coping with nutritional constraints to ensure successful development in an otherwise senescent environment. We show that the phytophagous leaf-mining moth Phyllonorycter blancardella (Lepidoptera) relies on bacterial endosymbionts, most likely Wolbachia, to manipulate the physiology of its host plant resulting in the ‘green-island’ phenotype—photosynthetically active green patches in otherwise senescent leaves—and to increase its fitness. Curing leaf-miners of their symbiotic partner resulted in the absence of green-island formation on leaves, increased compensatory larval feeding and higher insect mortality. Our results suggest that bacteria impact green-island induction through manipulation of cytokinin levels. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that insect bacterial endosymbionts have been associated with plant physiology.",10.1098/rspb.2010.0214,['Maintain ecological community'],prevent_allow_deformation,regulate_reproduction_growth,no_match,0.8064317444287693,0.07229855783035727,0.06682101122536994,3,3,3
56,Variation in annual and lifetime reproductive success of lance-tailed manakins: alpha experience mitigates effects of senescence on siring success,"The causes of variation in individual reproductive success over a lifetime are not well understood. In long-lived vertebrates, reproductive output usually increases during early adulthood, but it is difficult to disentangle the roles of development and learning on this gain of reproductive success. Lekking lance-tailed manakins provide an opportunity to separate these processes, as the vast majority of male reproduction occurs after a bird obtains alpha status and maintains a display area in the lek, but the age at which males achieve alpha status varies widely. Using 11 years of longitudinal data on age, social status and genetic siring success, I assessed the factors influencing variation in siring success by individuals over their lifetimes. The data show increases in annual reproductive success with both age and alpha experience. At advanced ages, these gains were offset by senescence in fecundity. Individual ontogeny, rather than compositional change of the population, generated a nonlinear relationship of breeding tenure with lifetime success; age of assuming alpha status was unrelated to tenure as a breeder, or success in the alpha role. Importantly, these findings suggest that social experience can mitigate the negative effects of senescence in older breeders.",10.1098/rspb.2011.1840,['Maintain ecological community'],prevent_allow_deformation,regulate_reproduction_growth,no_match,0.8064317444287693,0.07229855783035727,0.06682101122536994,3,3,3
57,A honey bee odorant receptor for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid,"By using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a honey bee [Apis mellifera (Am)] odorant receptor (Or) for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA). Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The “queen substance” [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 ± 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.",10.1073/pnas.0705459104,['Maintain ecological community'],prevent_allow_deformation,regulate_reproduction_growth,no_match,0.8064317444287693,0.07229855783035727,0.06682101122536994,3,3,3
58,Structural fiber reinforcement of keel blubber in harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena),"This study investigated the functional morphology of the blubber that forms the caudal keels of the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Blubber is a pliant biocomposite formed by adipocytes and structural fibers composed of collagen and elastic fibers. Caudal keels are dorsally and ventrally placed triangular wedges of blubber that define the hydrodynamic profile of the porpoise tailstock. Mechanical tests on carcasses demonstrate that when keels are bent, they strain nonuniformly along their lengths, with highest strains just caudal to the dorsal fin and lowest at the insertion of the flukes. Therefore, caudal keels undergo nonuniform longitudinal deformation while maintaining a stable, triangular cross-sectional shape. Polarizing and transmitted light microscopy techniques were used to investigate blubber's 3D fiber architecture along the length of the dorsal keel. The triangular cross-sectional shape of the keel appears to be maintained by structural fibers oriented to act as tensile stays. The construction of the blubber composite is regionally specific :structural fiber densities and diameters are higher in the relatively stiff caudal region of the keel than in the more deformable cranial keel region. The orientations of structural fibers also change along the length of the keel. Cranially, no fibers are oriented along the long axis, whereas a novel population of longitudinally oriented fibers reinforces the keel at the insertion of the flukes. Thus, differences in the distribution and orientation of structural fibers contribute to the regionally specific mechanical properties of the dorsal keel.",10.1002/jmor.10232,"['Move', 'Process resources']",change_chemical_color_pigmentation,convert_signals,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.6694100616240984,0.09514104601602744,0.07563886409983,3,3,3
59,Induced niche shift as an anti-predator response for an endoparasitoid,"When two developmental stages do not share the same ecological niche, the control of the niche shift through a change in developmental timing, referred to as ‘heterokairy’, can provide an adaptive advantage for the individual (e.g. if mortality risk is higher in the first niche). For endoparasitic species that develop inside another (host) species, mortality of the host may directly induce mortality risk for the parasite. Thus, endoparasitoid larvae should be selected for response to host predation. In this study, aphids previously parasitized by the endoparasitoid Endaphis fugitiva, Gagné and Muratori (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), were experimentally exposed to increased mortality risks. Both simulated attack and actual predator attacks against aphid hosts induced early emergence of the parasitoid larvae. Parasitoid emergence from the aphids occurred several minutes before the predator finished feeding on the aphid, allowing enough time for the parasitoid larvae to avoid direct predation. Predator-induced emergence produced significantly smaller parasitoid larvae than controls, but, interestingly, no effect on Endaphis adult size was found. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of induced emergence in an insect parasitoid, but we suggest that this mechanism might be at work in many other species where plasticity in development time allows the individual to perform an adaptive niche shift.",10.1098/rspb.2009.2029,"['Protect from harm', 'Sense send or process information']",cooperate_within_between_species,no_match,regulate_drag_turbulence,0.6884048599760442,0.16195732989675227,0.08965650117261618,4,4,4

We use a phylogenomic approach—ultraconserved element sequence capture—to investigate the evolutionary history of an iconic multispecies mutualism: Neotropical acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus group) and their associated Vachellia hostplants. In this system, the ants receive shelter and food from the host plant, and they aggressively defend the plant against herbivores and competing plants. We confirm the existence of two separate lineages of obligate acacia ants that convergently occupied Vachellia and evolved plant-protecting behaviour, from timid ancestors inhabiting dead twigs in rainforest. The more diverse of the two clades is inferred to have arisen in the Late Miocene in northern Mesoamerica, and subsequently expanded its range throughout much of Central America. The other lineage is estimated to have originated in southern Mesoamerica about 3 Myr later, apparently piggy-backing on the pre-existing mutualism. Initiation of the Pseudomyrmex/Vachellia interaction involved a shift in the ants from closed to open habitats, into an environment with more intense plant herbivory. Comparative studies of the two lineages of mutualists should provide insight into the essential features binding this mutualism.",10.1098/rspb.2016.2569,['Protect from harm'],no_match,cooperate_within_between_species,protect_from_radiation,0.6478842818986416,0.15466687496497963,0.08632103240915592,4,4,4
61,Evidence that dimethyl sulfide facilitates a tritrophic mutualism between marine primary producers and top predators,"Significance This study demonstrates that dimethyl sulfide, a chemical cue involved in global climate regulation, mediates a tritrophic mutualistic interaction between marine apex predators and primary producers. Our results imply that marine top predators play a critical role in maintaining both ocean health and global climate. Our results highlight the need for more collaboration and discussion between micro- and macroscale biologists working on global issues in the Southern Ocean. Tritrophic mutualistic interactions have been best studied in plant–insect systems. During these interactions, plants release volatiles in response to herbivore damage, which, in turn, facilitates predation on primary consumers or benefits the primary producer by providing nutrients. Here we explore a similar interaction in the Southern Ocean food web, where soluble iron limits primary productivity. Dimethyl sulfide has been studied in the context of global climate regulation and is an established foraging cue for marine top predators. We present evidence that procellariiform seabird species that use dimethyl sulfide as a foraging cue selectively forage on phytoplankton grazers. Their contribution of beneficial iron recycled to marine phytoplankton via excretion suggests a chemically mediated link between marine top predators and oceanic primary production.",10.1073/pnas.1317120111,"['Maintain ecological community', 'Sense send or process information']",no_match,cooperate_within_between_species,regulate_drag_turbulence,0.5080974193485241,0.44103243730000646,0.040229337616676304,4,4,4
62,Divergent investment strategies of Acacia myrmecophytes and the coexistence of mutualists and exploiters,"Ant-plant interactions represent a diversity of strategies, from exploitative to mutualistic, and how these strategies evolve is poorly understood. Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia–Pseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a nondefending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment–payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved.",10.1073/pnas.0904304106,['Protect from harm'],no_match,cooperate_within_between_species,protect_from_radiation,0.6478842818986416,0.15466687496497963,0.08632103240915592,4,4,4
63,Unique Structural Features Facilitate Lizard Tail Autotomy,"Autotomy refers to the voluntary shedding of a body part; a renowned example is tail loss among lizards as a response to attempted predation. Although many aspects of lizard tail autotomy have been studied, the detailed morphology and mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that tail shedding by the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) and the associated extracellular matrix (ECM) rupture were independent of proteolysis. Instead, lizard caudal autotomy relied on biological adhesion facilitated by surface microstructures. Results based on bio-imaging techniques demonstrated that the tail of Gekko gecko was pre-severed at distinct sites and that its structural integrity depended on the adhesion between these segments.",10.1371/journal.pone.0051803,"['Process resources', 'Change size or color', 'Protect from harm']",cooperate_within_between_species,convert_signals,no_match,0.8279419739067237,0.22535652550580954,0.21295119092685283,4,4,4
64,Distribution of unique red feather pigments in parrots,"In many birds, red, orange and yellow feathers are coloured by carotenoid pigments, but parrots are an exception. For over a century, biochemists have known that parrots use an unusual set of pigments to produce their rainbow of plumage colours, but their biochemical identity has remained elusive until recently. Here, we use high-performance liquid chromatography to survey the pigments present in the red feathers of 44 species of parrots representing each of the three psittaciform families. We found that all species used the same suite of five polyenal lipochromes (or psittacofulvins) to colour their plumage red, indicating that this unique system of pigmentation is remarkably conserved evolutionarily in parrots. Species with redder feathers had higher concentrations of psittacofulvins in their plumage, but neither feather colouration nor historical relatedness predicted the ratios in which the different pigments appeared. These polyenes were absent from blood at the time when birds were replacing their colourful feathers, suggesting that parrots do not acquire red plumage pigments from the diet, but instead manufacture them endogenously at growing feathers.",10.1098/rsbl.2004.0269,"['Sense send or process information', 'Change size or color']",change_structural_color,convert_signals,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.7898771629899125,0.237874000024017,0.004431186840479756,5,5,5
65,Absence of eye shine and tapetum in the heterogeneous eye of Anthocharis butterflies (Pieridae),"SUMMARY Insect eyes are composed of spectrally heterogeneous ommatidia, typically with three different types. The ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies can be identified non-invasively by the colorful eye shine, the reflection from the tapetal mirror located at the proximal end of the ommatidia, which can be observed by epi-illumination microscopy. Since the color of eye shine is determined by the spectral properties of the ommatidia, it has been tentatively related to color vision. In the course of a survey of ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies, we found that members of the pierid genus Anthocharis lack the eye shine. We therefore carried out anatomy of the eye of the yellow tip, Anthocharis scolymus, and correlated it with the absence of the tapetum. The butterfly tapetum is a remnant of the ancestral moth tapetum, a trait that has been completely lost in the papilionids and also, as now appears, in the genus Anthocharis. Anatomical investigations also revealed that, considering rhabdom shape, peri-rhabdomal pigment clusters and autofluorescence, the ommatidia can be divided in at least two different types, which are randomly distributed in the retina.",10.1242/jeb.002725,"['Protect from harm', 'Change size or color']",change_structural_color,convert_signals,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.48270333761548945,0.1743286166364012,0.12476364122638609,5,5,5
66,Pointillist structural color in Pollia fruit,"Biological communication by means of structural color has existed for at least 500 million years. Structural color is commonly observed in the animal kingdom, but has been little studied in plants. We present a striking example of multilayer-based strong iridescent coloration in plants, in the fruit of Pollia condensata. The color is caused by Bragg reflection of helicoidally stacked cellulose microfibrils that form multilayers in the cell walls of the epicarp. We demonstrate that animals and plants have convergently evolved multilayer-based photonic structures to generate colors using entirely distinct materials. The bright blue coloration of this fruit is more intense than that of any previously described biological material. Uniquely in nature, the reflected color differs from cell to cell, as the layer thicknesses in the multilayer stack vary, giving the fruit a striking pixelated or pointillist appearance. Because the multilayers form with both helicoidicities, optical characterization reveals that the reflected light from every epidermal cell is polarized circularly either to the left or to the right, a feature that has never previously been observed in a single tissue.",10.1073/pnas.1210105109,"['Sense send or process information', 'Change size or color']",convert_signals,regulate_reproduction_growth,no_match,0.4586212738005928,0.22156140540476024,0.17235138691737228,5,5,5
67,Evolution of the dragonfly head-arresting system,"The arrester or fixation system of the head in adult Odonata is unique among arthropods. This system involves the organs of two body segments: the head and the neck. It consists of a skeleton–muscle apparatus that sets the arrester parts in motion. The parts comprise formations covered with complicated microstructures: fields of microtrichia on the rear surface of the head and post–cervical sclerites of the neck. The arrester immobilizes the head during feeding or when the dragonfly is in tandem flight. Thus, it may serve as an adaptation to save the head from violent mechanical disturbance and to stabilize gaze in a variety of behavioural situations. This study shows the evolutionary trend of the arrester in the order Odonata by using scanning electron microscopy and measurements of arrester structures in 227 species from 26 odonate families. The arrester design occurring in the Epiophlebiidae, Gomphidae, Neopetaliidae, Petaluridae and Chlorogomphinae is suggested to be the basic one. Two convergent pathways of head–arrester evolution among Zygoptera and Anisoptera are proposed. The possible functional significance of the arrester system is discussed.",10.1098/rspb.1999.0668,['Attach'],cooperate_within_between_species,convert_signals,no_match,0.34407652340194855,0.22535652550580954,0.21295119092685283,5,5,5
68,Attractive and defensive functions of the ultraviolet pigments of a flower (Hypericum calycinum),"The flower of Hypericum calycinum, which appears uniformly yellow to humans, bears a UV pattern, presumably visible to insects. Two categories of pigments, flavonoids and dearomatized isoprenylated phloroglucinols (DIPs), are responsible for the UV demarcations of this flower. Flavonoids had been shown previously to function as floral UV pigments, but DIPs had not been demonstrated to serve in that capacity. We found the DIPs to be present in high concentration in the anthers and ovarian wall of the flower, suggesting that the compounds also serve in defense. Indeed, feeding tests done with one of the DIPs (hypercalin A) showed the compound to be deterrent and toxic to a caterpillar (Utetheisa ornatrix). The possibility that floral UV pigments fulfill both a visual and a defensive function had not previously been contemplated. DIPs may also serve for protection of female reproductive structures in other plants, for example in hops (Humulus lupulus). The DIPs of hops are put to human use as bitter flavoring agents and preservatives in beer.",10.1073/pnas.231471698,"['Protect from harm', 'Sense send or process information']",change_structural_color,change_chemical_color_pigmentation,maintain_biodiversity,0.6109074792725894,0.1455049337080603,0.12738266588910546,5,5,5
69,"Kingfisher feathers – colouration by pigments, spongy nanostructures and thin films","SUMMARY The colours of the common kingfisher, Alcedo atthis, reside in the barbs of the three main types of feather: the orange breast feathers, the cyan back feathers and the blue tail feathers. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the orange barbs contain small pigment granules. The cyan and blue barbs contain spongy nanostructures with slightly different dimensions, causing different reflectance spectra. Imaging scatterometry showed that the pigmented barbs create a diffuse orange scattering and the spongy barb structures create iridescence. The extent of the angle-dependent light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength. All barbs have a cortical envelope with a thickness of a few micrometres. The reflectance spectra of the cortex of the barbs show oscillations when measured from small areas, but when measured from larger areas the spectra become wavelength independent. This can be directly understood with thin film modelling, assuming a somewhat variable cortex thickness. The cortex reflectance appears to be small but not negligible with respect to the pigmentary and structural barb reflectance.",10.1242/jeb.062620,['Change size or color'],change_structural_color,convert_signals,compete_within_between_species,0.5709337654003179,0.4308190914010807,9.921597087075706e-11,5,5,5
70,Bioluminescent signals spatially amplified by wavelength-specific diffusion through the shell of a marine snail,"Some living organisms produce visible light (bioluminescence) for intra- or interspecific visual communication. Here, we describe a remarkable bioluminescent adaptation in the marine snail Hinea brasiliana. This species produces a luminous display in response to mechanical stimulation caused by encounters with other motile organisms. The light is produced from discrete areas on the snail's body beneath the snail's shell, and must thus overcome this structural barrier to be viewed by an external receiver. The diffusion and transmission efficiency of the shell is greater than a commercial diffuser reference material. Most strikingly, the shell, although opaque and pigmented, selectively diffuses the blue-green wavelength of the species bioluminescence. This diffusion generates a luminous display that is enlarged relative to the original light source. This unusual shell thus allows spatially amplified outward transmission of light communication signals from the snail, while allowing the animal to remain safely inside its hard protective shell.",10.1098/rspb.2010.2203,['Sense send or process information'],change_structural_color,convert_signals,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.8391954338605625,0.15815909473090717,0.004194568442783518,5,5,5
71,Super black and ultrathin amorphous carbon film inspired by anti-reflection architecture in butterfly wing,Abstract An ultrathin and super black amorphous carbon (a-C) film has been fabricated by borrowing the inverse V-type anti-reflection nano-architecture from the black wings of butterfly Ornithoptera goliath through vacuum sintering process. The biomimetic a-C film shows good optical absorption (99%) at low reflectance (,10.1016/j.carbon.2010.10.048,['Change size or color'],convert_signals,change_structural_color,prevent_allow_deformation,0.6443715855709271,0.27476545745336906,0.04918364295510597,5,5,5
72,Calcitic microlenses as part of the photoreceptor system in brittlestars,"Photosensitivity in most echinoderms has been attributed to ‘diffuse’ dermal receptors. Here we report that certain single calcite crystals used by brittlestars for skeletal construction are also a component of specialized photosensory organs, conceivably with the function of a compound eye. The analysis of arm ossicles in Ophiocoma showed that in light-sensitive species, the periphery of the labyrinthic calcitic skeleton extends into a regular array of spherical microstructures that have a characteristic double-lens design. These structures are absent in light-indifferent species. Photolithographic experiments in which a photoresist film was illuminated through the lens array showed selective exposure of the photoresist under the lens centres. These results provide experimental evidence that the microlenses are optical elements that guide and focus the light inside the tissue. The estimated focal distance (4–7 µm below the lenses) coincides with the location of nerve bundles—the presumed primary photoreceptors. The lens array is designed to minimize spherical aberration and birefringence and to detect light from a particular direction. The optical performance is further optimized by phototropic chromatophores that regulate the dose of illumination reaching the receptors. These structures represent an example of a multifunctional biomaterial that fulfills both mechanical and optical functions.",10.1038/35090573,['Sense send or process information'],cooperate_within_between_species,convert_signals,no_match,0.34407652340194855,0.22535652550580954,0.21295119092685283,5,5,5
73,Colour-producing β-keratin nanofibres in blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) feathers,"The colours of living organisms are produced by the differential absorption of light by pigments (e.g. carotenoids, melanins) and/or by the physical interactions of light with biological nanostructures, referred to as structural colours. Only two fundamental morphologies of non-iridescent nanostructures are known in feathers, and recent work has proposed that they self-assemble by intracellular phase separation processes. Here, we report a new biophotonic nanostructure in the non-iridescent blue feather barbs of blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) composed of parallel β-keratin nanofibres organized into densely packed bundles. Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering and two-dimensional Fourier analysis of electron micrographs of the barb nanostructure revealed short-range order in the organization of fibres at the appropriate size scale needed to produce the observed colour by coherent scattering. These two-dimensional quasi-ordered penguin nanostructures are convergent with similar arrays of parallel collagen fibres in avian and mammalian skin, but constitute a novel morphology for feathers. The identification of a new class of β-keratin nanostructures adds significantly to the known mechanisms of colour production in birds and suggests additional complexity in their self-assembly.",10.1098/rsbl.2010.1163,"['Sense send or process information', 'Change size or color']",change_structural_color,change_structural_color,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.6213886291067418,0.49126853926113323,0.005238125984541715,5,5,5
74,Always on the bright side of life: anti-adhesive properties of insect ommatidia grating,"SUMMARY The surface of some insect eyes consists of arrays of cuticular protuberances, which are 50–300 nm in diameter, and are termed corneal nipples or ommatidia gratings. They were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye's surface. Such a combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion.",10.1242/jeb.043661,['Protect from harm'],convert_signals,change_structural_color,prevent_allow_deformation,0.6443715855709271,0.27476545745336906,0.04918364295510597,5,5,5
75,Colourful parrot feathers resist bacterial degradation,"The brilliant red, orange and yellow colours of parrot feathers are the product of psittacofulvins, which are synthetic pigments known only from parrots. Recent evidence suggests that some pigments in bird feathers function not just as colour generators, but also preserve plumage integrity by increasing the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation. We exposed a variety of colourful parrot feathers to feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis and found that feathers with red psittacofulvins degraded at about the same rate as those with melanin and more slowly than white feathers, which lack pigments. Blue feathers, in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin, air and melanin granules, and green feathers, which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins, degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers. These differences in resistance to bacterial degradation of differently coloured feathers suggest that colour patterns within the Psittaciformes may have evolved to resist bacterial degradation, in addition to their role in communication and camouflage.",10.1098/rsbl.2010.0716,"['Maintain structural integrity', 'Protect from harm']",change_structural_color,convert_signals,regulate_reproduction_growth,0.48270333761548945,0.1743286166364012,0.12476364122638609,5,5,5
