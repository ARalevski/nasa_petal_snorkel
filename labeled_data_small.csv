10.1242/jeb.00764,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/207/2/211,Dynamics of leg muscle function in tammar wallabies (M. eugenii) during level versus incline hopping,"SUMMARY The goal of our study was to examine whether the in vivo force-length behavior, work and elastic energy savings of distal muscle-tendon units in the legs of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) change during level versus incline hopping. To address this question, we obtained measurements of muscle activation (via electromyography), fascicle strain (via sonomicrometry) and muscle-tendon force (via tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined (10Â°, 17.4% grade) treadmill at two speeds (3.3 m s-1 and 4.2 m s-1). Similar patterns of muscle activation, force and fascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions. This also corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement (duty factor, limb contact time and hopping frequency). During both level and incline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch and shortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain [LG: level, -1.0Â±4.6% (mean Â± s.e.m.) vs incline, 0.6Â±4.5%; PL: level, 0.1Â±1.0% vs incline, 0.4Â±1.6%] and muscle work (LG: level, -8.4Â±8.4 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -6.8Â±7.5 J kg-1 muscle; PL: level, -2.0Â±0.6 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -1.4Â±0.7 J kg-1 muscle). Consequently, neither muscle significantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during incline hopping. Whereas electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration and intensity did not differ for the LG, the PL exhibited shorter but more intense periods of activation, together with reduced EMG phase (P<0.01), during incline versus level hopping. Our results indicate that design for spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby, and the need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.",https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/207/2/211/1547720/211.pdf,TRUE,"['Move', 'Process resources']","['Store resources', 'Active movement']","['Store energy', 'Actively move through/on solids']","['Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB)', 'American Zoologist', 'Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation', 'Collagen: Structure and Mechanics']",jeb.biologists.org,,,"[90,6]"
10.1038/nature03647,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03647,Aerodynamics of the hovering hummingbird,"Despite profound musculoskeletal differences, hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are widely thought to employ aerodynamic mechanisms similar to those used by insects. The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size. This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests. Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that they may operate at Reynolds numbers sufficiently low to exploit a key mechanism typical of insect hovering. Hummingbird hovering approaches that of insects, yet remains distinct because of effects resulting from an inherently dissimilarâ€”avianâ€”body plan.",https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03647.pdf,TRUE,['Move'],['Active movement'],['Actively move through gases'],"['Nature', 'Proceedings of the Royal Society B', 'Journal of the Royal Society Interface']",www.nature.com,,,8

For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50â€ŠÎ¼m. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1â€ŠÎ¼m thick. This system, found on the wing scales of the butterfly Argyrophorus argenteus, comprises a distinctive variation in periodicity that runs parallel to the reflecting surface, rather than perpendicular to it. In this way, the requirement for an extensively thick system is removed.",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2008.0345.focus,TRUE,['Change size or color'],['Modify color'],['Change structural color'],['Journal of the Royal Society Interface'],royalsocietypublishing.org,,,96

Eight ostriches were induced to run along a trackway and execute turns. Ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics of the body and leg joints were simultaneously recorded, allowing calculation of joint angles and quasi-static net joint torques. Sidesteps, where the leg on the outside of the turn changes the movement direction, and crossovers using the inside leg, occurred with nearly equal frequency. Ostriches executed maneuvers using a simple control strategy that required minimal changes to leg kinematics or net torque production at individual joints. Although ostriches did use acceleration or braking forces to control body rotation, their morphology allowed for both crossovers and sidesteps to be accomplished with minimal net acceleratory/braking force production. Moreover, body roll and ab/adduction of the leg shifted the foot position away from the turn direction, reducing the acceleratory/braking forces required to prevent under- or over-rotation and aligning the leg with the ground reaction force.",https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/210/8/1378/1262587/1378.pdf,TRUE,['Move'],['Active movement'],['Actively move through/on solids'],"['Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB)', 'Proceedings of the Royal Society B', 'Journal of Anatomy']",jeb.biologists.org,,,6

The 60+ Myr fossil record of penguins spans an interval that witnessed dramatic shifts in Cenozoic ocean temperatures and currents, indicating a long interplay between penguin evolution and environmental change. Perhaps the most celebrated example is the successful Late Cenozoic invasion of glacial environments by crown clade penguins. A major adaptation that allows penguins to forage in cold water is the humeral arterial plexus, a vascular counter-current heat exchanger (CCHE) that limits heat loss through the flipper. Fossil evidence reveals that the humeral plexus arose at least 49 Ma during a â€˜Greenhouse Earthâ€™ interval. The evolution of the CCHE is therefore unrelated to global cooling or development of polar ice sheets, but probably represents an adaptation to foraging in subsurface waters at temperate latitudes. As global climate cooled, the CCHE was key to invasion of thermally more demanding environments associated with Antarctic ice sheets.",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0993,TRUE,['Protect from harm'],['Protect from non-living threats'],['Protect from temperature'],['Biology Letters'],royalsocietypublishing.org,,,19

Fast snap-trapping and suction of prey are two of the most spectacular examples for how these plants actively catch animals, mainly arthropods, for a substantial nutrient supply. We show that Drosera glanduligera, a sundew from southern Australia, features a sophisticated catapult mechanism: Prey animals walking near the edge of the sundew trigger a touch-sensitive snap-tentacle, which swiftly catapults them onto adjacent sticky glue-tentacles; the insects are then slowly drawn within the concave trap leaf by sticky tentacles. This is the first detailed documentation and analysis of such catapult-flypaper traps in action and highlights a unique and surprisingly complex mechanical adaptation to carnivory.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045735&type=printable,TRUE,['Process resources'],['Capture resources'],['Capture solids'],['PLOS One'],journals.plos.org,,,80

We describe a novel â€˜streamliningâ€™ response in tethered, flying honeybees in which the abdomen is held in a raised position when the visual system is exposed to a pattern of image motion that is characteristic of forward flight. This visually evoked response, which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow, presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight. The response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect. Thus, our results also underscore the importance of using panoramic stimulation for the study of visually guided flight in insects, and reveal the relative importance of various regions of the visual field in assessing the speed of flight through the environment.",https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/214/13/2215/1436663/2215.pdf,TRUE,['Maintain structural integrity'],['Manage structural forces'],['Manage drag/turbulence'],['Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB)'],jeb.biologists.org,,,26

We previously noted that some larvae did not freeze when cooled to â€“80Â°C, and we speculated that these larvae vitrified. Here we present evidence through differential scanning calorimetry that C. c. puniceus larvae transition into a glass-like state at temperatures <â€“58Â°C and can avoid freezing to at least â€“150Â°C. This novel finding adds vitrification to the list of insect overwintering strategies. While overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, C. c. puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around â€“40Â°C (and lower) when microhabitat is un-insulated because of low snow cover. Decreasing temperatures in winter are correlated with loss of body water from summer high levels near 2.0 to winter lows near 0.4 mg mgâ€“1 dry mass and concomitant increases in glycerol concentrations (4â€“6 mol lâ€“1) and thermal hysteresis. Finally, we provide direct evidence that Cucujus from Wiseman, Alaska, survive temperatures to â€“100Â°C.",https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-pdf/213/3/502/1272004/502.pdf,TRUE,['Protect from harm'],['Protect from non-living threats'],['Protect from temperature'],['Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB)'],jeb.biologists.org,,,19

The structural details of the attachment process are not yet entirely understood. We studied the attachment process of English ivy in detail and suggest a four-phase process to describe the attachment strategy: (i) initial physical contact, (ii) form closure of the root with the substrate, (iii) chemical adhesion, and (iv) shape changes of the root hairs and form-closure with the substrate. These four phases and their variations play an important role in the attachment to differently structured surfaces. We demonstrate that, in English ivy, different mechanisms work together to allow the plant's attachment to various climbing substrates and reveal the importance of micro-fibril orientation in the root hairs for the attachment based on structural changes at the subcellular level.",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2010.0140,TRUE,['Attach'],['Attach permanently'],,['Journal of the Royal Society Interface'],royalsocietypublishing.org,,,0

Their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat. Spiders are closely associated with silk, a material, often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences. However, it is often overlooked that more than half of all Recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation. These species must have found other, more economic solutions for prey capture and retention, compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity. Here we show that hairy adhesive pads (scopulae) are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style, resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least, equal importance as the derived web building taxa. Previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion, neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads (claw tufts) are suitable for those purposes. The former observations, that scopulae are used in prey capture, are largely overlooked. Our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are, in most cases, a secondary development. Evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones, as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further. Hypotheses about the origin of the adhesive setae and their diversification throughout evolution are provided.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062682&type=printable,TRUE,['Attach'],['Attach temporarily'],,['PLOS One'],journals.plos.org,,,1
